BOGGLE SOLVER
By Sam Kauffman
2023

Have you ever played a game of Boggle and thought, I wonder what words are in
there that we missed? Wonder no more!

This program solves the game Boggle by generating a list of all valid words for
a given board. It works for standard Boggle (4x4), Big Boggle (5x5), and Super
Big Boggle (6x6). The blank cube from Super Big Boggle can be interpreted as a
block (as in the official rules) or as a wild (as in Scrabble).

It works with whatever word list you provide. Two lists word_list.txt and
word_list2.txt are included. These are lists I found on the Internet. I cannot
confirm if either of them is actually the official word list used in Scrabble
and Boggle. Both word lists contain all word forms (e.g., jump, jumps, jumped,
jumping) and do not include proper nouns. word_list.txt has 178,691 words and
is used by this program by default. word_list2.txt has 173,529 words.

The program convert_word_list.py reads word_list.py, or whatever word list you
provide, converts it to a format the Boggle solver understands, and saves it as
converted_word_list.json. The program boggle.py then uses this converted word
list.

Run boggle.py to instantly see all the valid words for a given Boggle board.
Select the board size, and then enter the cubes row by row as prompted. A cube
may be:
  - any single letter
  - any pair of letters
  - a block: #
  - a wild: *

If all you want to do is run the program, you only need to download
convert_word_list.json and boggle.py. Put them in the same folder. You need to
have Python 3 installed on your computer. In a command prompt window, go to that
folder and type:

python boggle.py
